This project is about quarter backs in the NFL from 1996. We chose a dataset with some important metrics missing, in order for us to exersice our knohow in pythion
Our main objectives with the data was to show if the the level of queter backs had increased over the years we ar consindering. Further, we would like to highligt the development of the best quarter backs each year.

We start of by construcing a heat map so we had a better understanding of the correltion of our data variables. To understand better what would be interesting to examine further.


We had to clean up the data since some players had miss informing metrics abiut their skill level as a quarter back. This could be if they only made one throw and completed that and such they got a near perfect passer rating(158)

Since we did not have a metric for games played we had to use home_away as a metric as such. 

We then consentrated the data around players who had more that 80 passer rating over 8 games each season, the latter idicates that the player played at least half the season. 

This gave us the possibility of making a relevent plots

After highligting the generel development of the league we found it intereting to looking at one of the all tim greats, Tom Brady

For this we found it interesting to se how his pionts differed over the years in home and away games, for show this we made a boxplot
After priting out every uniqu player name the same could be done for every other player if of interest
